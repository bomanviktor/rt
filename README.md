## Creating Objects
### Sphere

To create a sphere object, use the `Sphere` struct from `sphere.rs`. Here's an example:

```rust
let sphere = Sphere::new(position, radius, material);
```

### Cube
```rust
let cube = Cube::new(min, max, material);
```

### Plane
```rust
let plane = FlatPlane::new(normal, distance, material);
```

### Cylinder
```rust
let cylinder = Cylinder::new(base, axis, radius, material);
```
